Agentic AI Financial Assistant
This project is an AI-powered financial assistant designed to interactively gather a user's financial information and create a comprehensive, personalized investment and financial plan. The assistant follows a structured, step-by-step process to ensure a thorough and accurate plan.

Key Features:
Interactive Data Gathering: The assistant collects information sequentially, starting with basic details (name, income, gender, age) and moving on to net worth, emergency funds, expenses, assets, liabilities, and financial goals.

Encouraging Tone: It maintains a positive and encouraging tone, summarizing the user's situation at key stages to provide clarity and build trust.

Loan and Tax Optimization: The assistant asks about existing loans (personal, gold, home, student, car, or Loan Against Property) and provides applicable tax deduction suggestions under Indian law.

Comprehensive Financial Planning: The final plan is designed to be comprehensive, considering:

Taxable and non-taxable income.

A balanced mix of high-risk and low-risk investments.

Diversification across liquid and non-liquid assets.

Expense coverage and tax optimization.

Investment Recommendations: It suggests allocations in both government-backed options (PPF, EPF, NSC, Sukanya Samriddhi, Sovereign Gold Bonds) and private options (mutual funds, equity, NPS, real estate, insurance-linked products).

Visual Data Representation: The final output includes text-based bar graphs and pie charts to visually represent financial data.

Structured Output: The final document is professional, featuring a disclaimer at the beginning and end, and a quarter-wise roadmap of investments and expected returns.
